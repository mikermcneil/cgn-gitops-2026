# Fleets are available in Fleet Premium.

# This file updates policies, queries, agent options, controls, and software for hosts assigned to the "Workstations" fleet.

# To add another fleet, create a new file in the fleets/ directory and copy and paste the contents from this file.
# Update the secret in the new file, then create the corresponding secret in GitHub Actions secrets.
# Then add that secret to .github/workflows/workflow.yml as an env variable.
# The secret name in the YAML file must match the secret name in GitHub Actions secrets.
